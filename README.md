# Apache Sling Scripting HTL Sling Models Use Provider (deprecated)

This module is part of the [Apache Sling](https://sling.apache.org) project, but it is no longer maintained.

Version 1.4.0-1.4.0 of the [`org.apache.sling.scripting.sightly`](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-scripting-sightly) module makes this module obsolete, since the functionality of the `SlingModelsUseProvider` has been fully integrated into the HTL Script Engine.

For reference or potential bugfix releases please use the [`maintenance`](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-scripting-sightly-models-provider/tree/maintenance) branch.
